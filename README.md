## Introduction

Meetily is a privacy-first AI meeting assistant that runs entirely on your local machine. It captures your meetings, transcribes them in real-time, and generates summaries, all without sending any data to the cloud. This makes it the perfect solution for professionals and enterprises who need to maintain complete control over their sensitive information.

## Why Meetily?

While there are many meeting transcription tools available, this solution stands out by offering:

- **Privacy First:** All processing happens locally on your device.
- **Cost-Effective:** Uses open-source AI models instead of expensive APIs.
- **Flexible:** Works offline and supports multiple meeting platforms.
- **Customizable:** Self-host and modify for your specific needs.

<details>
<summary>The Privacy Problem</summary>

Meeting AI tools create significant privacy and compliance risks across all sectors:

- **$4.4M average cost per data breach** (IBM 2024)
- **€5.88 billion in GDPR fines** issued by 2025
- **400+ unlawful recording cases** filed in California this year

Whether you're a defense consultant, enterprise executive, legal professional, or healthcare provider, your sensitive discussions shouldn't live on servers you don't control. Cloud meeting tools promise convenience but deliver privacy nightmares with unclear data storage practices and potential unauthorized access.

**Meetily solves this:** Complete data sovereignty on your infrastructure, zero vendor lock-in, and full control over your sensitive conversations.

</details>

## Features

- **Local First:** All processing is done on your machine. No data ever leaves your computer.
- **Real-time Transcription:** Get a live transcript of your meeting as it happens.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Generate summaries of your meetings using powerful language models.
- **Multi-Platform:** Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Open Source:** Meetily is open source and free to use.
- **🆕 Meeting Auto-Detection:** Automatically detect Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet meetings and start recording (Fork feature).
- **🆕 Dark Mode:** Full dark mode support with Light, Dark, and System theme options.

## Key Features in Action

### 🎯 Local Transcription

Transcribe meetings entirely on your device using **Whisper** or **Parakeet** models. No cloud required.

</p>

### 🤖 AI-Powered Summaries

Generate meeting summaries with your choice of AI provider. **Ollama** (local) is recommended, with support for Claude, Groq, OpenRouter, and OpenAI.

</p>

### 🔒 Privacy-First Design

All data stays on your machine. Transcription models, recordings, and transcripts are stored locally.

</p>

### ⚡ GPU Acceleration

Built-in support for hardware acceleration across platforms:

- **macOS**: Apple Silicon (Metal) + CoreML
- **Windows/Linux**: NVIDIA (CUDA), AMD/Intel (Vulkan)

Automatically enabled at build time - no configuration needed.

### 🌙 Dark Mode (Fork Feature)

Full theme support with three options:

- **Light Mode:** Clean, bright interface for daytime use
- **Dark Mode:** Eye-friendly dark interface for low-light environments
- **System:** Automatically matches your operating system's theme preference

Configure your preferred theme in Settings → General → Theme.

## Meeting Auto-Detection (Fork Feature)

> **⚠️ Note:** This feature has been tested on macOS only. Windows support is experimental and untested.

This fork adds automatic meeting detection that can start recording when you join a video call:

### Supported Applications

| Application | macOS | Windows | Linux |
|-------------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Zoom** | ✅ Full support | ⚠️ Untested | ⚠️ Untested |
| **Microsoft Teams** | ✅ Full support | ⚠️ Untested | ⚠️ Untested |
| **Google Meet** | 🔶 Limited* | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ Not implemented |

*Google Meet runs in browsers, so detection requires window title inspection which has limited support.

### How It Works

1. **Process Monitoring:** The app monitors running processes to detect meeting applications
2. **Meeting Detection:** When Zoom or Teams processes are detected, the app identifies an active meeting
3. **Auto-Recording:** Optionally start recording automatically when a meeting is detected
4. **Auto-Stop:** Optionally stop recording when the meeting ends

### Configuration

Enable meeting detection in Settings → Meeting Detection:

- **Enable/Disable:** Toggle automatic meeting detection
- **Auto-start Recording:** Automatically begin recording when a meeting is detected
- **Auto-stop Recording:** Automatically stop recording when the meeting ends
- **Notifications:** Get notified when meetings are detected
- **Per-app Settings:** Enable/disable detection for specific apps (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet)

### Privacy

Meeting detection only monitors process names to identify video conferencing applications. **No meeting content, audio, or video is accessed until you explicitly start recording.** All detection happens locally on your device.

## System Architecture

Meetily is a single, self-contained application built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/). It uses a Rust-based backend to handle all the core logic, and a Next.js frontend for the user interface.

For more details, see the [Architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## For Developers

If you want to contribute to Meetily or build it from source, you'll need to have Rust and Node.js installed. For detailed build instructions, please see the [Building from Source guide](docs/BUILDING.md).

### Package Manager

This fork uses **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** as the JavaScript package manager instead of pnpm:

```bash
# Install Bun (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install Bun (Windows)
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"

# Install dependencies
cd frontend
bun install

# Development
bun run tauri:dev

# Build
bun run tauri:build
```

### Development Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun install` | Install dependencies |
| `bun dev` | Start Next.js dev server |
| `bun run tauri:dev` | Start Tauri in development mode |
| `bun run tauri:build` | Build production app |
| `bun tauri dev` | Alternative dev command |
